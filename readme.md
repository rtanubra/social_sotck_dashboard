<h1>Stock Dashboard</h1>

A lightweight stock dashboard that allows you to see a stock's last trading day performance, past 100 day performance, and trending news articles of the day.

<h2>Motivation</h2>

I wanted to create a simple lightweight version of Apple's stock dashboard application. Present numerical/graphical information on a stock/company and relevant news about the company.

<h2>Future Feateures:</h2>

1. Toggle between:

    1.1 a simple closing line chart built on the closing prices of a stock.

    1.2 an Open High Low Close (OHLC) /candlestick chart of a stock.

2. Compare stock performance of more than 1 stock per session.
3. Save stocks of interest so a user can conduct a quick search.
