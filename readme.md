Stock Dashboard
A lightweight stock dashboard that allows you to see a stock's last trading day performance, past 100 day performance, and trending news articles of the day.

Motivation
I wanted to create a simple lightweight version of Apple's stock dashboard application. Present numerical/graphical information on a stock/company and relevant news about the company.
